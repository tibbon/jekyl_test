# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

  Voice Movement Therapy (VMT) is an expressive arts therapy working with the links between the breath, voice, physicality, and psyche. 
  Our stories are held in our voices, in our bodies; VMT gives us a container to explore and express, expand and embody. 
  VMT offers a non-judgmental approach to voice work and does not categorize voices using typical Westernized vocal categories, 
  exploring instead the wide range of human sound in a therapeutic setting. 
  For more info, visit the International Association of Voice Movement Therapy.
